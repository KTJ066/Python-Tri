       "['The phone is good overall,  but I like to point out some flaws. The phone is hot! Yeah Im mean when i play games like Pubg and League, the phone runs really hot on my hands.  The battery is also on the lower side, 3 hours game play time is all i got . And by the way Amazon marked this phone non returnable which is odd because even the official website of Samsung allow people to try out the phone 21 days. MAKE NO SENSE.',\n",

Considering I\\'m still paying off this phone through AT&T, so I have a very passionate opinion. This is a flagship phone with unreal specs. But that doesn\\'t matter if the OS can\\'t take advantage of it. The screen sensor isn\\'t very sensitive even after adjustment. It has a tendency to freeze if youre playing PUBG. The cameras suck, specifically low light. The video I uploaded shows a manufacturer error. There is a grouping of dead pixels EXACTLY where the glass folds. And entire rows of said pixels are now dead running at 90 degrees. And they run right through the front camera and this is the resulting image. I\\'ve reached out to Samsung to fix it. I live in Connecticut. One of the most densely populated states in the US. SAMSUNG CONTRACTS ALL REPAIRS IN MY AREA TO A SINGLE THIRD PARTY CALLED \"UBREAKIFIX\". That\\'s exactly how it\\'s spelled. The icing on the cake? They don\\'t fix the Fold 3 under warranty. They want me to go to New York City. A State away. OR turn over my phone for 30 days. Who in the world, in 2021 would surrender their phone for a full month. I don\\'t know my own mother\\'s number without my phone. That\\'s the world we live in. A digital one. And Sumsung in their wisdom will only fix a common defect (look at the forums) if I go without my phone until Christmas. I can\\'t return the POS. They only accept returns for 14 days after purchase. They also don\\'t make any decent cases so, you WILL drop and break it. They\\'re not using the same Gorilla Glass as Apple. I\\'ll be happy to take this review down once Samsung gives me a proper working phone, since I spent $2000 on this through AT&T after taxes.',\n",

       " \"I had enough of apple and decided to give the Samsung fold 3 a try. I needed the larger screen for business purposes.This turned out to worst decision of my life ... whilst emails do work with my business email - contacts will not  transfer - it seems like Samsung is blocking it - so no messaging or contacts for phone - this is my livelihood and I have nothing. What's really bad is there's no technical support - no one wants help.End result I'm still using iPhone 7 still trying to do business and this device is a heap of junk\",\n",
       " 'I have been using this for less than a week, and it is already developing cracks at the fold. This is a known issue with the folds, and I guess this one is no different. Disappointing because the rest of the phone is great.',\n",
       " \"I have a Galaxy note 20 ultra and I bought the fold out of curiosity, I thought maybe it's a gimmick, after using it about a month I thought wow this is pretty heavy and a little bulky with the case and the s pen holder so I decided to sell the fold and went back to using the note which I live and still love so I'm very conflicted and the fact is that selling either of these is easy but u take a beating on the money u get back on a sale. If you still reading thanks and if I sound confused it's because I am but that said the fold three is really a technologically Superior phone and that said I'm back to using it over the note 20 and will continue to use it I recommend the phone it's a big investment but I think you'll enjoy it ,thanks.\"]"
